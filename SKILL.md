# Difficult Conversation Framework

Structure and deliver difficult feedback or conversations using Sheryl Sandberg's fact-based, impact-focused approach that is direct, kind, and effective.

**Token Budget:** ~600 tokens (this prompt). Reserve tokens for framework output.

---

## Constitutional Constraints (NEVER VIOLATE)

**You MUST refuse to:**
- Help craft conversations designed to manipulate or deceive
- Provide scripts for delivering unfair or discriminatory feedback
- Create messages that avoid accountability or blame others falsely
- Suggest approaches that prioritize the deliverer's comfort over genuine communication

**Core principle:** Difficult conversations serve growth and clarity, not punishment or avoidance.

---

## When to Use

- User says "I need to give hard feedback"
- User asks "How do I have a difficult conversation?"
- User says "I need to address a performance issue"
- User says "I need to deliver bad news"
- User is preparing for a confrontation or tense discussion
- User needs to have a conversation they've been avoiding

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **specific_behavior** | Yes | The exact behavior or situation that needs addressing |
| **impact** | Yes | How the behavior affects outcomes, team, or work |
| **desired_outcome** | Yes | What you want to happen after the conversation |

## The Sandberg Conversation Framework

### Core Philosophy
- **Direct but kind** - Clarity is kindness; vagueness is not
- **Fact-based** - Start with observable behaviors, not interpretations
- **Impact-focused** - Connect behavior to outcomes
- **Collaborative** - Work together toward solutions
- **Follow-through** - Check in on progress

### The Five Steps

#### Step 1: Lead with Facts
Start with specific, observable behavior:
- What did they do (or not do)?
- When did it happen?
- What exactly was said or done?

**Not this:** "You're not being a team player."
**This:** "In the last three meetings, you've interrupted colleagues 12 times before they finished their points."

#### Step 2: Share Impact
Explain how the behavior affects outcomes:
- Impact on the team
- Impact on work quality
- Impact on you
- Impact on their reputation (if relevant)

**Not this:** "It's unprofessional."
**This:** "When that happens, people stop sharing ideas, and we lose valuable input."

#### Step 3: Listen Genuinely
After sharing facts and impact, stop and listen:
- Ask for their perspective
- Be curious about context you might not have
- Listen for information that might change your view
- Don't use listening as a performance; actually hear them

**Ask:** "I'd like to understand your perspective. What's your view on this?"

#### Step 4: Collaborate on Solutions
Work together on the path forward:
- What does success look like?
- What specific changes would address the issue?
- What support do they need?
- What will you do differently, if anything?

**Not this:** "You need to fix this."
**This:** "Let's figure out how to address this together. What would help you do this differently?"

#### Step 5: Follow Through
Commit to checking in:
- Set a specific time to revisit
- Define what you'll be looking for
- Make it a dialogue, not surveillance

**Say:** "Let's check in on this in two weeks. I want to see how it's going and adjust if needed."

## Workflow
### Phase 1: Prepare
Before the conversation:

### Step 1: Write down the specific behavior (facts only)



### Step 2: Articulate the impact clearly



### Step 3: Identify your desired outcome



### Step 4: Consider their likely perspective



### Step 5: Check your own emotions - are you ready to listen?



### Phase 2: Open
Start the conversation:

### Step 1: State your intention: "I want to talk about something important because I care about [you/the team/our work]."



### Step 2: Present facts



### Step 3: Share impact



### Step 4: Pause for their response



### Phase 3: Explore
Create dialogue:

### Step 1: Listen to their perspective



### Step 2: Ask clarifying questions

## Outputs

Format the output as a **Conversation Framework**:

```markdown
## Difficult Conversation Framework

### Context
**Person:** [Who you're talking to]
**Relationship:** [Your relationship to them]
**Desired outcome:** [What success looks like]

---

### Step 1: Facts (Prepare these statements)

**Specific behavior:**
"[Exact, observable behavior without interpretation]"

**Timing/Frequency:**
"[When this happened, how often]"

---

### Step 2: Impact (Prepare these statements)

**Impact statement:**
"When [behavior], the effect is [specific impact on work/team/outcomes]."

**Why this matters:**
"This is important because [connection to shared goals/values]."

---

### Step 3: Listen (Prepare these questions)

**Opening for their perspective:**
"I'd like to understand your view. What's your take on this?"

**Follow-up questions:**
- "Help me understand what was happening for you when [behavior]."
- "Is there context I'm missing?"
- "What would have helped you handle this differently?"

---

### Step 4: Collaborate (Prepare these prompts)

**Future state:**
"What I'd like to see going forward is [specific desired behavior]."

**Collaboration prompt:**
"What would help you do this differently? What support do you need from me?"

**Your commitment:**
"Here's what I'll do: [your action]."

---

### Step 5: Follow Through

**Check-in commitment:**
"Let's revisit this on [specific date]. I'll be looking for [specific indicators]."

---

### Sample Opening Script

"I want to talk about something important. I'm raising this because I care about [you/our team/our work].

In [specific situation], I observed [specific behavior]. The impact of that was [specific impact].

I'd like to understand your perspective. What's your view on this?"

---

### Anticipate Responses

**If they get defensive:**
"I hear that this is hard to hear. I'm not trying to attack you - I'm trying to solve this together."

**If they disagree with the facts:**
"Help me understand what you saw differently. Let's make sure we're working from the same information."

**If they're upset:**
"I can see this is landing hard. Do you want to take a moment before we continue?"

**If they accept and commit:**
"I appreciate you hearing this. I'm confident you can make this change."
```

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| User wants to avoid the conversation | Validate discomfort; reinforce that clarity is kindness |
| User's "facts" are actually interpretations | Help separate behavior from judgment |
| User wants to vent, not prepare | Distinguish venting from conversation prep |
| High-stakes conversation (firing, etc.) | Recommend HR involvement; focus on dignity |
| User is the less powerful party | Adapt for power dynamics; focus on "I" statements |

---

## Constraints

- Do not use this analysis as the sole basis for critical decisions
- Do not apply this framework to situations outside its intended scope
- Acknowledge that analysis is based on available data, which may be incomplete
- Honor the complexity of real-world situations that resist simple categorization
- Present findings with appropriate confidence levels
- Recognize the limits of the methodology

## Example

**Input:**
```
specific_behavior: Team member consistently misses deadlines without advance notice
impact: Creates last-minute scrambles, other team members have to pick up work, losing trust with stakeholders
desired_outcome: Get advance warning when deadlines are at risk; improve reliability
relationship_context: Direct report, been on team 1 year, otherwise good performer
```

**Output:**
```markdown
## Difficult Conversation Framework

### Context
**Person:** Direct report
**Relationship:** Manager-report, 1 year tenure, generally good performer
**Desired outcome:** Proactive communication about deadline risks; improved reliability

---

### Step 1: Facts

**Specific behavior:**
"In the past month, you've missed three project deadlines - the Q4 report, the client presentation, and the vendor evaluation."

**Timing/Frequency:**
"In each case, I found out on or after the due date that the work wasn't ready."

---

### Step 2: Impact

**Impact statement:**
"When deadlines are missed without advance notice, the team has to scramble to cover - Sarah had to work over the weekend on the client presentation. It also affects our credibility with stakeholders."

**Why this matters:**
"Reliability and communication are core to how we build trust, both within the team and with our partners."

---

### Step 3: Listen

**Opening for their perspective:**
"I'd like to understand what's been happening. What's your view on these situations?"

**Follow-up questions:**
- "Help me understand what was happening with your workload when these deadlines came up."
- "Was there something that made it hard to flag these earlier?"
- "Is there a pattern I should understand?"

---

### Step 4: Collaborate

**Future state:**
"What I need going forward is early warning. If a deadline is at risk, I need to know at least 3 days ahead so we can adjust or get help."

**Collaboration prompt:**
"What would help you flag risks earlier? Is there something about how work is assigned that makes this harder?"

**Your commitment:**
"I'll check in mid-project on timeline confidence, and I'll make it clear that flagging risk early is valued, not penalized."

---

### Step 5: Follow Through

**Check-in commitment:**
"Let's check in on this in 3 weeks. I'll be looking at whether deadlines are being met or communicated about in advance."

---

### Sample Opening Script

"I want to talk about something important. I'm raising this because you're a valuable contributor and I want to help you succeed here.

In the past month, you've missed three project deadlines - the Q4 report, the client presentation, and the vendor evaluation. In each case, I found out at or after the due date.

The impact is that the team has to scramble, and it affects our credibility. I'd like to understand what's been happening from your perspective."

---

### Anticipate Responses

**If they cite overwhelm:**
"That's important context. Let's look at your workload together and see if we need to adjust."

**If they didn't realize the impact:**
"I appreciate you hearing that. Now that you know, what would help you communicate earlier?"

**If they're embarrassed:**
"I know this is hard to hear. I'm not trying to shame you - I'm trying to fix this with you."
```
